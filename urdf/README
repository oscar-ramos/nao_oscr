"naoV40red.urdf" is a NAO model that does not include the fingers as
articulated joints (they are used only to open or close the hand, anyways). It
has 26 degrees of freedom instead of 42.

This nao urdf has been taken from
    nao_description/urdf/naoV40_generated_urdf/nao.urdf
but "continuous" joints (fingers) have been changed to "fixed"
